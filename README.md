# My fork of dwm - dynamic window manager

## Custom features:
- I removed the colored rectangle in the middle that display the name of the window you are on. 
- Ctrl + Alt + T to spawn an alternate terminal (cool-retro-term by default).

## Patches:
- Anypar and IPC to allow the use of polybar-dwm-module (patched polybar from the AUR) which I don't use anymore.
- Functional gaps, gaps that can be toggled with SUPER+A and increased/decreased with SUPER+./, 
- Swallow patch so that the terminal "swallows" any window that it spawns such as media players (mpv, sxiv, etc.)
- Fibonacci mode (ALT + R), very cool sometimes 
- Statuscolor, makes the regular status bar not look like shit!!!
